Check the myapp.log file to make sure no exceptions are thrown Once the application runs you should see something like this

2023-08-03T11:13:15.039+01:00 INFO 36080 --- [ main] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer : Tomcat started on port(s): 8090 (http) with context path '' 2023-08-03T11:13:15.050+01:00 INFO 36080 --- [ main] com.routePlanner.htc.HtcApplication : Started HtcApplication in 5.718 seconds (process running for 6.248)

About the Service:-

The service is a route planner REST service. It uses an in-memory database (H2) to store the data. You can also do with any database. If your database connection properties work, you can call some REST endpoints defined in com.routePlanner.htc.controller; on port 8090. (see below)

Here are the endpoints you can call:-

GET: /transport/{distance}?passengers={number}&parking={days} - returns the cheapest vehicle to use (and the cost of the journey) for the given distance (in AUs), number or passengers and days of parking
http://localhost:8090/transport/2?passengers=8&parking=0 Response: HTTP 200 Personal Transport is the cheapest vehicle to use with the journey cost of Â£1.2

GET: /accelerators - returns a list of accelerators with their information
Response: HTTP 200 [ { "id": 1, "accelerator_id": "SOL", "accelerator_name": "Sol", "connections": "{"RAN":"100","PRX":"90","SIR":"100","ARC":"200","ALD":"250"}" }, { "id": 2, "accelerator_id": "PRX", "accelerator_name": "Proxima", "connections": "{"SOL":"90","SIR":"100","ALT":"150"}" }, { "id": 3, "accelerator_id": "SIR", "accelerator_name": "Sirius", "connections": "{"SOL":"80","PRX":"10","CAS":"200"}" }, { "id": 4, "accelerator_id": "CAS", "accelerator_name": "Castor", "connections": "{"SIR":"200","PRO":"120"}" }, { "id": 5, "accelerator_id": "PRO", "accelerator_name": "Procyon", "connections": "{"CAS":"80" }" }, { "id": 6, "accelerator_id": "DEN", "accelerator_name": "Denebula", "connections": "{"PRO":"5","ARC":"2","FOM":"8","RAN":"100","ALD":"3"}" }, { "id": 7, "accelerator_id": "RAN", "accelerator_name": "Ran", "connections": "{"SOL":"100"}" }, { "id": 8, "accelerator_id": "ARC", "accelerator_name": "Arcturus", "connections": "{"SOL":"500","DEN":"120"}" }, { "id": 9, "accelerator_id": "FOM", "accelerator_name": "Fomalhaut", "connections": "{"PRX":"10","DEN":"20","ALS":"9"}" }, { "id": 10, "accelerator_id": "ALT", "accelerator_name": "Altair", "connections": "{"FOM":"140","VEG":"220"}" }, { "id": 11, "accelerator_id": "VEG", "accelerator_name": "Vega", "connections": "{"ARC":"220","ALD":"580"}" }, { "id": 12, "accelerator_id": "ALD", "accelerator_name": "Aldermain", "connections": "{"SOL":"200","ALS":"160","VEG":"320"}" }, { "id": 13, "accelerator_id": "ALS", "accelerator_name": "Alshain", "connections": "{"ALT":"1","ALD":"1"}" } ]

GET: /accelerators/{acceleratorID}- returns the details of a single accelerator
http://localhost:8090/accelerators/SOL Response: HTTP 200 { "id": 1, "accelerator_id": "SOL", "accelerator_name": "Sol", "connections": "{"RAN":"100","PRX":"90","SIR":"100","ARC":"200","ALD":"250"}" }

GET: /accelerators/{acceleratorID}/to/{targetAcceleratorID} - returns the cheapest route from acceleratorID to targetAcceleratorID
http://localhost:8090/accelerators/SOL/to/VEG Response: HTTP 200 [ "SOL", "PRX", "ALT", "VEG" ]

To view H2 in-memory database:-

Application runs on H2 in-memory database. To view and query the database you can browse to http://localhost:8090/h2-console. Default username is 'sa' with password as 'password'.
